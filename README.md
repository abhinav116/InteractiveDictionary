# InteractiveDictionary
Building an interactive dictionary using python 
-> Returns the meaning of the word input given by user on the command line
-> Checks all combinations of lowercase and uppercase of a word before declaring it non-existant.
-> If user mis-spells a word, the application gives the closest possible word the user might want to check the meaning of. Eg. Give input as rainn.
-> Acronyms and Nouns are accounted for.
